 Food Bank of the World - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to food bank support,
food production, and food insecurity across various countries. 
 The goal is to discover global trends in food availability, analyze disparities, and provide insights to inform
humanitarian food distribution strategies.

Objective

- Understand the global food situation through quantitative analysis.
- Identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in food production, supply, and hunger indicators.
- Support decision-making for equitable food distribution and policy-making.

Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation
- **NumPy**: for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: for visualizations
- **Plotly Express**: for interactive plots
- **Jupyter Notebook**: as the analysis environment

 Visualizations & Analysis Highlights

- Bar charts of **global vs regional food production**.
- Heatmaps showing **correlations between food metrics**.
- Choropleth maps identifying **geographical food insecurity patterns**.
- Boxplots to detect **distribution and outliers** in specific indicators.
- Time series analysis showing **changes in food supply over time**.

 Key Insights

- Countries with lower food production tend to have higher hunger indexes.
- Some regions show a paradox of food abundance but persistent food insecurity.
- A strong correlation exists between economic development and food availability.

Dataset

- Source: Public dataset e.g., FAO/UN/World Bank 
- Contains fields such as:
  - Country
  - Total food production
  - Population undernourishment
  - Daily food supply (kcal)
  - Hunger Index scores
  - Regional classifications
